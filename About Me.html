				  <h3>Motivation Behind the Project</h3>
					<p>Welcome to my profile! My name is Nidia Guadarrama. I am a rising Sophomore at Illinois Tech where I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology and Management. I am interested in encouraging more people to use technology to help them in their everyday lives. I hope to accomplish this by protecting user data in order to promote safe application usage.​</p>
					<p>Outside of work, I enjoy reading and listening to music. My favorite thriller I've read so far is Three Blind mice by James Patterson. I have over 30 books by James Patterson, he is by far my favorite author. I also like dystopian novels, especially the Hunger Games and Divergent series.</p>
					<p>I am primarily exploring careers in cybersecurity and information technology but I am open to learning new things because I believe every opportunity is valuable. I am a team player, organizational, good at problem solving, and I also have good time management skills. I am currently seeking part-time positions to contribute to honing my communication skills and problem-solving abilities as well as to gain work experience.</p>

				  <h3>Final Product</h3>
					<h6>For my final project I created a chess set and a case for the chess set. I used three different machines for this project including a laser cutter, 3D printer, and 3D carver.</h6>

				  <h3>Challenges</h3>
					<p>I encountered challenges while designing the top part of the case. The first challenge I encountered was finding a way to design the pieces so that they would fit together like a puzzle. This was very difficult since it wasn't a normal shape like a cube or rectangle. Another issue I faced was designing a circle and triangle combined. I chose to make this symbol because I thought it would look cool but it was hard to make because if I did it wrong then the pieces would fall through. In the end, I was able to design it so that the pieces stayed on the actual piece of wood. Overall, thinking of ways to represent the Aztecan culture was difficult because a lot of websites had unreliable information. After scouring the internet, I was able to find a very detailed article from a museum that listed all of their artifacts along with descriptions.</p>

				  <h3>Materials, Tools, and Resources</h3>
					<p>For this project, I used three different machines. I designed the top part of the case in Adobe Illustrator and then cut the design onto a piece of wood. In order to put the pieces together I had to design them so that once they were cut they would fit together like a puzzle. I put the pieces together with wood glue which made it look better as opposed to using screws that would have left a lot of space. I designed each chess piece in AutoCAD software called OnShape and ran two print jobs, one for each color set. Lastly, I used a 3D carver to make the base of the case. I designed it on Easel and it took over an hour to carve the design.</p>
