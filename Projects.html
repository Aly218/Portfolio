				  <h2>Motivation Behind the Project</h2>
					<p>I chose to make a chess set because my father and I like playing chess and I wanted to make him his own custom chess set. I am Mexican-American and my ancestors were Aztecs, so I decided to make a chessboard that resembled that part of my culture. An Aztec god and flower are etched onto the chessboard. I took my time and did research to find symbols that are actually a part of Aztecan culture instead of the Mayan culture. I also carved the Aztecan worship temple into the base of the case. On the front of the top part of the case, I etched a simplified version of the Aztec calendar onto it. The actual top part is in the shape of a pyramid so that it resembles the Aztec temple of worship.</p>

				  <h2>Materials, Tools, and Resources</h2>
					<p>For this project, I used three different machines. I designed the top part of the case in Adobe Illustrator and then cut the design onto a piece of wood. In order to put the pieces together I had to design them so that once they were cut they would fit together like a puzzle. I put the pieces together with wood glue which made it look better as opposed to using screws that would have left a lot of space. I designed each chess piece in AutoCAD software called OnShape and ran two print jobs, one for each color set. Lastly, I used a 3D carver to make the base of the case. I designed it on Easel and it took over an hour to carve the design.</p>
